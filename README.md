# helmet-detection-yolov5
Detect helmets on construction workers
⛑️ Helmet Detection for Safety Compliance (YOLOv5)Project OverviewThis project implements a custom YOLOv5s Object Detection Model to monitor safety compliance by classifying individuals as wearing a helmet or not. The work involved building a complete deep learning pipeline from data preparation and cross-platform training to local deployment.MetricResult (After 50 Epochs)InterpretationOverall mAP@.5$83.6\%$High general accuracy and strong localization capability.'With Helmet' mAP@.5$91.5\%$Excellent reliability for the positive detection class.Inference Speed$\approx 122$ ms/image (Local CPU)Suitable for near real-time desktop applications.Technical Achievements (for BS AI Documentation)Cross-Platform Training: Successfully utilized Google Colab GPU for training via transfer learning, demonstrating knowledge of cloud-based resource management.Data Pipeline: Developed Python scripts for:Annotation Conversion: Transforming raw Pascal VOC (.xml) annotations into the required YOLO format (.txt).Data Splitting: Creating a verified $80/20$ train/validation split.Cross-OS Compatibility Patch (Critical Debugging): Resolved the recurring and complex PyTorch serialization issue (AttributeError: 'collections.OrderedDict' object has no attribute 'float') encountered when loading the GPU-saved model onto a Windows CPU environment. This required surgical patching of the models/experimental.py file to manually handle the dictionary of weights (state\_dict), showcasing advanced debugging skills in the PyTorch framework.🚀 Local Inference SetupFollow these steps to run the trained model on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.10+ (with torch, torchvision installed).Clone the Repository: Ensure the project folder is locally synchronized.1. Install DependenciesNavigate to the yolov5 subdirectory and install the requirements:Bashcd helmet-detection-yolov5/yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Model PlacementEnsure the final trained weights file, best.pt (downloaded from Colab), is placed directly inside the yolov5/ directory.3. Run DetectionExecute the script using a forward-slash path for reliable Windows operation:Bash# Example command using the test image:
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source "C:/Computer vision/LABS/project/test1.jpeg" --conf 0.6
The output image with bounding boxes is saved to the runs/detect/exp[N] directory.
